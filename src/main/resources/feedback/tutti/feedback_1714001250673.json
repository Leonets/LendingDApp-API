After a few minutes analyzing the page, I carried out the tests with some transactions not being carried out. The bad payer NFT I think took a while to appear in my wallet because I set the due date for the next day and received it well after that. The exact data is not recorded by me, but if I could check it, it would be great to update the protocol. I paid for the bad payer's NFT and it's still in my wallet and I can't tell if I made the lower payment.","stokenet_address":"account_tdx_2_128l7rvj5l36hsskhdx25nn7g7537thutc8qet58yzupdvtz92xqmg2 ","mainnet_address":"account_rdx12ywe6kvell7flpxhmdv6f55t2a3759a82kg0n0cugu0fv5p6wl3ry5","telegram_nickname":"@balrog1979","blackbox_testing":"Yes"}
