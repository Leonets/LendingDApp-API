"Excellent protocol! The best I've ever tested on the Radix network, due to the diversity and velocity of operations.
The test went perfectly well, and the data was written instantly, without any errors, to the NFT received when I registered.
I used each protocol option a few times, and, in addition to being fast, it is very easy to use.
Impressive!
Congratulations to the team!"

"I really liked the idea, although I couldn't understand how to guarantee payment of the debt, but the protocol is very interesting,
note that when I enter a fractional value the transaction gets an error."

"I really think that lending platforms have a lot to evolve, but there are still no mechanisms for this.
Perhaps real-world assets will bring some hope."

"I believe that DAPP is very well designed and very well organized.
For me there was no error, not even when I went to claim the faucet tokens.
The only suggestion I have is regarding the front end, which could be cleaner and with more instructions
for users, containing information boxes and instructions on top."

"ITs an interesting idea to have a zero collateral protocol,
i think that the main aspect of it its going to be how to protect the people that are lending and providing liquidity
to the protocol, the risk of not getting paid is too high, finding a functional solution for this could be a really disruptive for the protocol...
the option to make a deal with other protocols to block those users to interact with other
dApps was something i thought about last week, but how this prevent those players to just send their assets to another
account that doesnt have the bad player nft  and still interact with protocols? Unless you have a massive
tracking system that can identify alternative accounts i think is something that it needs to be well thought and well implemented"

"I believe that the BadPayer NFT alone is not enough to guarantee the repayment of loans.
Malicious people would create countless wallets just to borrow and not pay.
Maybe I still have a limited view of the project, I'll try to understand it better."

"Remake it all, UI doesnt look attractive, and, i tried borrowing low and high volumes, and both of them,
the fees were the same, doesnt make sense. Better to make a proportional fee for borrowers"

"The loan does not show the accrued interest, when we pay in advance the interest appears and
I was no longer able to pay the remainder because the amount is low"

"Platform with an excellent idea but it has its risks. If it continues to grow with good ideas,
it could become an innovative platform in the crypto market."

"its good test fantastic platform in radix "

"I managed to pay more than I borrowed. There should be a lock so we don't pay extra by mistake.
Greater clarity of errors. Right now I haven't been able to get a loan and I don't know why. INVALID DECIMAL ERROR"

"the application was very slow to verify the wallet between the Dapp, it may be due to the new IOS update on the
RADIX wallet. Other than that, the project idea is incredible and I think it will be very important for the growth
of the radix ecosystem."

"I honestly didn't think the information described was very clear as well as the usability,
after payment (if I did it correctly) the NFT from the bad payer didn't disappear, however the idea is very good and
it's something that could be useful as a pioneer in the RADIX ecosystem, may the creators be successful."

"After making a supply, it is not possible to make new ones."

"This platform is fast, all functions works well. "

"I like this protocol same way i like weft "

"When typing a number with a decimal place, the error appears (error=generatorerror(invalidDecimal(490,1),
it would be ideal to lock in the text box allowing you to enter only integers.
After withdrawing the suply, the suply value is not updated in the text box,
leaving the user without knowing the value he still has in the fund."

"I thought the idea was really cool, I'm still going to test the platform further to better
understand the functionality, I didn't find any bugs, but I was able to use the loan
payment by entering 0, there was no blockage."

"When trying to provide liquidity it generated an error:applicationError(VaultError(Resource))"

"So far everything is in order, but when I request repayment the following error message appears.
ApplicationError(PanicMessage(You cannot refund less than 20% of your loan ! @ src/ utils.rs:159:))"

"- When borrowing with a date above 2024, an error is returned
- It is possible to enter negative numbers for supply and borrow
- It is not possible to make more than 1 supply or borrow at the same time"

"I paid off the loan on time but I still have the Bad Payer NFT.
I liked the idea of being blocked on other platforms if the person had the Bad Payer NFT,
but the person could send this NFT to another account or other people"

"When carrying out transactions with the wallet, some errors appeared, but apparently due to the waiting time,
it could be due to the new Android update of the wallet.
Another thing to mention is that the front end could be made more user-friendly for users
who are not familiar with loans, as it would facilitate and help expand borrowers and lenders"

"So far using the test net I found it to be a very interesting proposal, I feel very excited about the app"

"All operations were carried out: supply, loans, withdrawal and repayment. The NFT appeared for being a bad payer"

"I found some bugs in the supply liquidity part, and when paying the loan there are always amounts to pay"

"I took out some loans:
On the first loan I paid half and then the other half, but the system continued to indicate that I owed some amount.
In some loans I was unable to authorize the transaction in the wallet, as it asked me to choose a interest rate (but no other rate other than the pre-selected rate appeared) so I was unable to complete the loan authorization
Another loan transaction had a decimal error in the Wallet app, although the amount entered was a integer number. Even if the input was a decimal number, the problem occurred.
After the deadline I did not receive the BadPayer NFT."

"Deve ser informado a porcentagem e o valor total a ser pago pelo empréstimo, quando for realizar o pagamento,
assim fica mais prático do que ter que calcular. "

"I think you can put a restriction on badpayer to didnt
use more and only can use the platform who have a minimum quantity of Radix."

"1. I haven't seen the BADPLAYER NFT. A contract appeared in my wallet, I didn't understand what it was and even after paying it didn't disappear.
2. The borrow to be paid should already include interest. To avoid the need for 2 transactions
3. How to know how much I can borrow. Because if I want to get 1000 radix I can, but if I want to get 500 and then another 500 I can't.
3.1 There could be a way to know our limit so we can have control instead of being forced to borrow the entire amount the first time (even without needing to)
4. It could have the date MM/DD/YYYY so we know the day to pay"

"I believe in the potential of the project and will follow its development."

"My badpayer nft was not removed after the debt was paid.
I paid the debt more than once and the spare balance did not return to my wallet"

"I thought the proposal was cool, I'm looking forward to the app"

"When returning the loan, the interest does not appear, then the app does not allow you to pay the interest because the amount is low
congratulations on the project"

"1-Very simple interface yet;
2-I was able to borrow without providing supplies;
3-In my NFT registration the message appeared 'No match found';
4-If you use the buttons without entering any value, an error appears in the wallet;
5-I was unable to lend, there must be a lack of liquidity to be able to lend without collateral;
6-The protocol is not working I was unable to provide liquidity as well;
7 - The item 'Your Position' must be very evident and highlighted to the user.
8-the option to register disappeared"

"These are my first days testing your dapp. So far I haven't had any problem
to report since everything is working correctly even using two different computers and three different browers.
I'm really enjoying how fast it is. I know it's still a testing dapp but the layout isn't
very intuitive and friendly user. I found difficult to understand the real amount to repay.
However I liked it and will continue to test it."

"I had put a date in the past and I still got the loan,but it looks like
you would fix it, I'll still make the payment and see if the NFT will be burned
I couldn't deposit more than 2k xrd and I also couldn't"

"At first I found the tests a little confusing, I think I need to direct the tests a little better.
After a few minutes analyzing the page, I carried out the tests with some transactions not
being carried out. The bad payer NFT I think took a while to appear in my wallet because I
set the due date for the next day and received it well after that. The exact data is not
recorded by me, but if I could check it, it would be great to update the protocol.
I paid for the bad payer's NFT and it's still in my wallet and I can't tell if I made the lower payment."

"Hi, I applied for a loan yesterday, but I missed the deadline for repayment and received
a NFT LendingDapp BadPayer. Later on, I made the payment, but I wasn't exactly sure how much
money I owed. So, I paid the value of the credit plus 10. But nor delete the bad payer nft."

"I received the 'BadPayer' NFT when I didn't pay the loan.
However, as I paid the loan little by little to test the app, when the
outstanding balance was less than 100 I was unable to make the payment anymore,
it always gave an error. I tried to borrow more to pay the arrears and it also failed."

"Many times the transaction simply failed and was not carried out"

"I paid the loan and the lendingDapp Badpayer did not disappear from the wallet"

"I noticed that even though I made the loan payment, the BADPAYER NFT was not removed from the wallet."

"I understood product innovation. would add a function to nft badpayer. it could be linked to a stake for
example and follow that stake if it were removed to another account. the stake would be mandatory to be
in the wallet and the NFT would be linked to that stake. I honestly don't know if this is possible, they are just ideas."

"In the initial tests a few days ago, there were errors and freezes, but the form wasn't available for reporting.
I redid some tests and the error didn't occur again."

"Intersting and ivnovating idea"

"I tested it but I still don't understand what the use would really be. But I will follow the development of the project."

"I made all my considerations on the Telegram channel, and was promptly answered. I am gratefull for that.
Unfortunately, I didn't test stop paying what I borrowed, so I didn't receive BadPayer nft,
 but I'm going to test it today and send feedback through the Telegram channel."

"I understood product innovation. would add a function to nft badpayer.
it could be linked to a stake for example and follow that stake if it were removed to another account.
 the stake would be mandatory to be in the wallet and the NFT would be linked to that stake.
 I honestly don't know if this is possible, they are just ideas."

 "SUPPLY working, presents error when you let the supply botton
also we get a error message when use ',' instead of '.' - decimal error and try
to supply an amount lower then 100 xrd. It's working for a 100.01 xrd supply.
After that, I've got the LendingDapp NFT in my wallet.
WITHDRAW botton functioning well.
Tried to supply more 500, but doesn't work. Error message 'No loan accepted if the previous is not closed yet'.
BORROW and REPAY functions working, but after taking a 250 xrd borrow and repaying
 the entire amount two minutes later, an additional try for borrowing 500 xrd more
 presented a error and I couldn't complete the transaction, said I had to payback
 the previous one even if I just did it."

"There were no errors during interactions between the radix wallet and the Dapp.
The project is very well designed and I believe it will be very successful.
I believe that the main thing to do is review the contract and the mathematical
formulas to avoid problems, as happened with GABLE.
The other project, WEFT, was on a giant rise, bringing the community and
encouraging BETA TESTERS from the beginning (I was one), giving several Tokens
as an incentive and along with that, offering even greater benefits to those who
provided liquidity, with this , pleased the community and no one dumped the project.
 I believe they should walk this way, with the community and distributing tokens to
 those who help them with the tests. We know that the WEFT problem was just like GABLE,
 with mathematical formulas, and I hope they review everything and are always ready to
 listen to the community. Left Gable because the project owner didn't listen to the community"

 "I really enjoyed using the platform."

 "It was extremely easy to use but the protection of the contract can, in my opinion cause many doubts and fears for the users."
